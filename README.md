 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. By utilizing **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, an **LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model is trained to predict future stock prices with an accuracy of 85%. The project applies various preprocessing techniques such as normalization and time series analysis to improve the model's performance. A comprehensive report is also provided, outlining the model development, validation process, and investment strategy recommendations.

 Libraries Used

Scikit-Learn (sklearn): Used for data preprocessing, such as splitting data into training and testing sets and scaling features.
TensorFlow: A deep learning framework used to build and train the machine learning model.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, used to create and train the LSTM model.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of RNN that is especially useful for time series predictions, like stock price forecasting.

 Features

Data Preprocessing:
    - Normalization of stock price data to ensure the model can learn effectively.
    - Time series analysis to handle sequential data (historical stock prices).
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model validation.

Model Development:
    - Building an LSTM-based RNN model to capture temporal dependencies in stock prices.
    - Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization for better accuracy.

Evaluation:
    - Measuring the performance of the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy.
    - Validation of the model on test data to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Predictions:
    - Using the trained model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
    - Visualizing the predictions against the actual stock prices for comparison.
